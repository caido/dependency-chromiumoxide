## [Unreleased]

### Breaking Changes

Due to the support of new browsers in the fetcher, we changed the API.
The changes are mainly related to how you can request a specific version of the browser.
Previously you could only request a chromium revision, now we support chrome versions, channel and milestone.

```rust
BrowserFetcherOptions::builder()
  .with_kind(BrowserKind::Chrome)
  .with_version(BrowserVersion::Channel(Channel::Beta))
  .build()
```

We also change the output format of the `fetch`. It is now called a `BrowserFetcherInstallation`
and contains a `BuildInfo`. We garantee that at least the version or revision will be present
in that struct, but not always both.

```rust
let installation = chromiumoxide_fetcher::BrowserFetcher::new(options).fetch().await?;
println!("Executable path: {}", installation.executable_path.display());
```

### Changed

- Bumped MSRV to 1.85 to support edition 2024
- Update `async-tungstenite` to 0.32.0
- Update `which` to 8.0.0
- Replace `winreg` by `windows-registry`
- Updated PDL to r1519099 (Chromium 142.0.7431.0)
- Updated fetcher to r1520176 (Chromium 142.0.7435.0)
- Fetch now supports `Chrome for testing` and `Chrome Headless Shell`

### Added

- Add option to disable automation detection
- Expose the `cmd` module for access to `CommandChain`

### Fixed

- Fixed typo in feature `_fetcher-rustls-tokio`
- More resilient message parsing, it should now not crash on unknown events coming from the browser
- Extensions should only be disabled when no extensions are provided
